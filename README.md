ANDREW CHI-CHIH YAO
China – 2000
Andrew Chi-Chih Yao was born in Shanghai, China, on December 24, 1946. After moving with his family to Hong Kong for two years he immigrated to Taiwan. In 1967 he received a B.S. in Physics from the National University of Taiwan. He then started graduate studies in Physics at Harvard University, where he received an A.M. in 1969 and a Ph.D. in 1972 under the supervision of Sheldon Glashow, winner of the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics. He subsequently entered the Ph.D. program in Computer Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, and received his degree just two years later, in 1975. Yao completed his dissertation, A Study of Concrete Computational Complexity, under the supervision of Chung Laung Liu.

After a year as an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department at MIT, Yao joined the Computer Science Department at Stanford University as an Assistant Professor in 1976. Over the next five years there he made a number of fundamental contributions to the theory of algorithms.

His 1977 paper “Probabilistic computations: toward a unified measure of complexity,” [1] introduced what is now known as Yao’s min-max principle, which uses von Neumann’s minimax theorem from game theory to relate average-case complexity for deterministic algorithms to worst-case complexity for randomized algorithms. Yao proved that the expected running time of any randomized algorithm on worst-case input is equal to the average-case running time of any deterministic algorithm for the worst-case distribution of inputs. Yao’s principle has become a fundamental technique for reasoning about randomized algorithms and complexity, and has also been applied in areas such as property testing and learning theory.
